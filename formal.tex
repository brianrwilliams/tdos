\section{(Twisted) Differential operators via formal geometry}

The purpose of this section is to describe a model for twisted differential operators using the language of Gelfand--Kazhdan formal geometry. 


\subsection{A quick review of descent}

We follow the approach of Gelfand and Kazhdan \cite{GK} for the construction of ``natural" objects in differential geometry. 
By natural, we mean that these construction apply uniformly over the category of smooth manifolds (of a fixed dimension) possibly equipped with a local geometry (such as a symplectic or complex structure). 

The central object, associated to each smooth $n$-manifold $X$, is the bundle of coordinates $X^{coor}$. 
The fiber over a point $x \in X$ consists of the space of formal coordinates centered at $x$. 
This is the space of $\infty$-jets of local diffeomorphisms of the $n$-disk $D^n$ to an open neighborhood of $x$ sending $0 \in D^n$ to $x$. 
In other words, this is the space of maps from the {\em formal disk} $\hD^n$ to the formal completion of $X$ near the point $x$. 
The formal disk $\hD^n$ is defined as the affine formal scheme with ring of functions given by formal power series $\RR[[t_1,\ldots,t_n]]$.
The bundle $X^{coor} \to X$ is a principal bundle for the group of automorphisms of this formal scheme that fix the maximal ideal, which we denote $\Aut_n$. 
This principal $\Aut_n$-bundle factors through the ordinary $\GL_n$ frame bundle $\Fr_X \to X$, in since there is a natural map of bundles $X^{coor} \to {\rm Fr}_X$ that truncates the full $\infty$-jet to remember only the linear jet. 

The crucial point of formal geometry is that this principal $\Aut_n$-bundle carries a {\em flat connection}. 
The flat connection is valued in the Lie algebra of {\em all} formal vector fields $\Vect$.	
The Lie algebra of $\Aut_n$ consists of formal vector fields that vanish at the origin, which is a strict sub Lie algebra of all formal vector fields, so we are leaving the ordinary category of principal bundles with connection.

\subsection{Formal Lie algebroids}

In this section we define formal Lie algebroids.
These are Lie algebroids on the formal disk, in the same way that the category $\VB_n$ provides a model for vector bundles on the formal $n$-disk. 

\begin{dfn} A {\em formal Lie algebroid} is an object $\sL \in \VB_n$ together with
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] A $\CC$-linear bracket $[-,-] : \sL \times \sL \to \sL$ and
\item[(ii)] an ``anchor" map $a : \sL \to \hT_n$
\end{itemize}
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] $[-,-]$ and $a$ are equivariant for the action of $(\Vect, \GL_n)$,
\item[(2)] $a$ is $\hO$-linear, and
\item[(3)] for any $x,y\in \sL$ and $f \in \hO_n$ one has
\ben
[x, f \cdot y] -  f \cdot [x,y]  = a(x)\cdot f .
\een
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\brian{I want to say that this is a Lie-Reinhert algebra in the category $\VB$...}

We define the category $\Algbd_n$ to be the full subcategory of $\VB_n$ consisting of formal Lie algebroids.
The following is an immediate consequence of the functoriality of descent.
\begin{lem}
Suppose $\sL$ is a formal Lie algebroid. 
Then, $\desc_{\GK}(\sL)$ is a Lie algebroid on the category of smooth $n$-manifolds. 
In particular, for each manifold $X$, $\sdesc_X(\sL)$ has the structure of a Lie algebroid on $X$.
\end{lem}

\brian{say what I mean by a ``Lie algebroid on a category"}

\subsubsection{Enveloping algebroid}

To any Lie algebra we can assign an associative algebra through its universal enveloping algebra. \brian{blah blah}

Let $\sL$ be a formal Lie algebroid. Consider the left $\hO_n$-module
$\hO_n \oplus \sL$. This direct sum has a natural Lie algebra
structure given by
\ben
[(f, x), (g,y)] := (a(x) \cdot f - a(y) \cdot g, [x,y]) .
\een 
Let $U_{\rm Lie}(\hO_n \oplus \sL)$ be the universal envelope of this
Lie algebra. 
Note that there is a natural augmentation map $\epsilon : U_{\rm Lie}(\hO_n \oplus \sL) \to \RR$.

\begin{dfn}
Let $\sL$ be a formal Lie algebroid. 
Denote by $\Bar{U}$ the augmentation ideal with respect to $\epsilon$, and let $I\subset \Bar{U}$ be the ideal generated by
\ben
i(f,0) \tensor i(g,x) - i(fg, f x) 
\een 
for $x \in \sL$ and $f,g\in \hO_n$.
The {\em enveloping algebra} of the formal Lie algebroid $\cL$ is the quotient
\ben
\sU_{\hO_n} (\sL) := \Bar{U} / I .
\een 
\end{dfn}

It is immediate to see that $\sU_{\hO_n}(\sL)$ is an associative algebra object in the category of formal vector bundles. 
By monoidality of the descent functor, we $\sdesc_{\GK}(\sL)$ is a sheaf of associative algebras on the category of $n$-manifolds. 

The next proposition follows from properties of the $\sdesc$ functor, specifically Lemma \ref{lem:descexact}; as $\sdesc$ is right exact, it in particular preserves finite colimits.  

\begin{prop}\label{prop:enveloping}
Let $\sL$ be a formal Lie algebroid and $X$ a smooth manifold equipped with a Gelfand--Kazhdan structure. 
Then, there is an isomorphism of sheaves of associative algebras on~$X$:
\ben
\sdesc_X(\sU_{\hO_n}\sL) \cong \sU_{\sO_X} (\sdesc(\sL)) .
\een
\end{prop}
