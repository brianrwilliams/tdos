\begin{prop} 
For any choice of Gelfand-Kazhdan structure $\sigma$ on a smooth manifold $X$,
there is an isomorphism 
\ben
\bdesc(\sigma, \fg_n) \cong \fg_X 
\een 
of sheaves on $X$ of curved $\L8$ algebras.
\end{prop}

We have already seen how the action of $\Vect$ on $\fg_X$ extends to
an action of $\Vect$ on the dg Lie algebra $\DD \fg_n^\RR$ defining
the classical field theory. As a corollary of the above we obtain. 

\begin{cor} Let $\DD \fg_X^\RR$ be the curved $\L8$ algebra defining
  one-dimensional Chern-Simons with target $X$. Then
$\desc(\sigma, \DD \fg_n^\RR) \cong \DD \fg_X^\RR$.
\end{cor}




\ryan{Note that $\Omega^\ast (S^1) \otimes -$ commutes with descent and the shifted symplectic structure only depends on the source: it's just the Kronecker pairing on the target.}

Thus, one-dimensional Chern-Simons \owen{theory!} with target the formal $n$-disk
descends to one-dimensional Chern-Simons with target any smooth
manifold.

\end{prop}

\begin{lem}
If the classical descends and the obs def descends than a formal quantization descends (up to homotopy) to an a priori quantization of the global theory.
\end{lem}

\begin{cor}
The formal quantization descends (up to homotopy) to the quantization constructed in GG...
\end{cor}
